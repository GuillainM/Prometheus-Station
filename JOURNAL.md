## Day 1 - December 26, 2025 (Afternoon)

### ✅ Step 1: Raspberry Pi Setup - COMPLETED

**Total time:** ~1 hour 45 minutes  
**Difficulty experienced:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆ Easy (as promised!)

---

### Phase 1: SD Card Preparation (30 minutes)

#### What I did:

1. **Downloaded Raspberry Pi Imager v2.0.0**
   - Source: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
   - File size: ~25 MB
   - Installation: 2 minutes

2. **Flashed Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**
   - Path: Choose OS → Raspberry Pi OS (other) → Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
   - Target: SanDisk Extreme 256GB microSD
   - Download size: ~483 MB

3. **Configured headless setup** (the "magic" part!)
   - Clicked NEXT → EDIT SETTINGS
   - New tabbed interface in Imager v2.0 (cleaner than expected!)

**Settings configured:**

**Hostname tab:**
- Hostname: `prometheus-station`
- Why: Easier to remember than IP address

**User tab:**
- Username: `guillain` (personal choice, not "prometheus" from guide)
- Password: [strong password set]
- Why custom username: Better security than default

**Wi-Fi tab:**
- SSID: [my home network]
- Password: [configured]
- Country: FR (France)
- Result: Pi will connect to WiFi on first boot automatically

**Localisation tab:**
- Timezone: Europe/Paris
- Keyboard: fr (AZERTY)

**Remote access tab:**
- ✅ Enable SSH
- Authentication: Use password
- Critical: Without this, I'd need monitor/keyboard forever

#### Time breakdown:
- Download Imager: 2 min
- Configure all settings: 8 min
- Write to SD card: 12 min
- Verification: 5 min
- Safe eject: 1 min
- **Total: 28 minutes**

#### Notes:
- SanDisk Extreme A2 writes fast (12 min for 483MB + verification)
- Imager v2.0 interface is very intuitive
- Headless config saved SO MUCH TIME (no monitor/keyboard setup needed)

---

### Phase 2: First Boot & SSH Connection (20 minutes)

#### Hardware setup:

1. Inserted microSD card into Raspberry Pi 4
   - Card slot on underside (spring-loaded)
   - Clicked into place perfectly

2. Connected official USB-C power supply (5V 3A)
   - No power button, just plug and go
   - Red LED: steady (power good)
   - Green LED: blinking (reading SD card)

3. Waited for boot
   - ~30 seconds: Green LED rapid blinking
   - ~60 seconds: Green LED occasional flashes (boot complete)
   - Total boot time: About 45 seconds

#### Finding the Pi's IP address:

**Method used:** Router admin page
- Logged into router at 192.168.1.1
- Found device list
- Spotted "prometheus-station" immediately
- IP assigned: `192.168.1.41`

**Alternative I could have used:**
```powershell
ping prometheus-station.local
```
(Works on Windows 10+, would have shown IP)

#### First SSH connection:

```powershell
ssh guillain@prometheus-station
```

**First-time security prompt:**
```
The authenticity of host 'prometheus-station (192.168.1.41)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:fIhIFX6kZYXAXoLgxPbqDLquacySa9GKz05kdrLtXaA.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Typed: `yes`

Entered password.

**SUCCESS!** 🎉

```
Linux Prometheus-Station 6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 1:6.12.47-1+rpt1 (2025-09-16) aarch64

guillain@Prometheus-Station:~ $
```

**First impressions:**
- Headless setup worked PERFECTLY
- No monitor needed at any point
- Hostname resolution worked immediately
- Modern kernel (6.12.47, newer than guide mentioned!)

---

### Phase 3: SSH Key Authentication Setup (10 minutes)

#### The problem:
Typing password for every SSH connection is annoying. I knew I'd be connecting dozens of times during this build.

#### The solution: SSH keys

**What I learned:**
- SSH keys use public/private key cryptography
- Private key stays on my PC (secret)
- Public key goes on the Pi (shareable)
- More secure than passwords AND more convenient

#### Step-by-step what I did:

**1. Generated SSH key pair on Windows:**

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "guillain@prometheus-station"
```

- Chose ED25519 (modern, secure, fast)
- Saved to default location: `C:\Users\loutr\.ssh\id_ed25519`
- No passphrase (for convenience)
- Generated in ~2 seconds

**2. Copied public key to Pi:**

```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh guillain@prometheus-station "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

- Had to type password ONE LAST TIME
- Command creates `.ssh` folder on Pi and adds my public key

**3. Secured permissions on Pi:**

Connected via SSH, then:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Why: Prevents other users from reading my authorized keys

**4. Created SSH alias for ultra-fast connection:**

On Windows, created file: `C:\Users\loutr\.ssh\config`

```powershell
notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config
```

Added this content:
```
Host prometheus
    HostName prometheus-station
    User guillain
    IdentityFile C:\Users\loutr\.ssh\id_ed25519
```

**5. Tested the magic:**

```powershell
ssh prometheus
```

**INSTANT CONNECTION. NO PASSWORD.** 🚀

**Time saved:**
- Before: `ssh guillain@prometheus-station` + type password (10 seconds)
- After: `ssh prometheus` + instant (2 seconds)
- Over 100+ connections during build: ~13 minutes saved!

**Why this is brilliant:**
- More secure (2048-bit key vs guessable password)
- Faster (no typing)
- Works with scp, rsync, git, etc.
- Industry standard (how professionals work)

---

### Phase 4: Initial System Configuration (45 minutes)

#### System updates:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Results:**
- 47 packages needed updating
- Download size: ~68.2 MB
- Time: ~35 minutes (my internet is decent but not amazing)

**What was updated:**
- Security patches
- Kernel stayed at 6.12.47 (already latest)
- Various system libraries
- Debian base packages

**Observation:** First update always takes longest. Future updates will be faster.

#### raspi-config settings:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

**Changes made:**

1. **Advanced Options → Expand Filesystem**
   - Made entire 256GB available (was limited to ~2GB)
   - Critical for Wikipedia files later

2. **Performance Options → GPU Memory**
   - Set to 16 MB (minimum)
   - Why: Headless server doesn't need GPU RAM
   - Freed up ~240 MB for Kiwix

3. **Interface Options → SSH**
   - Verified enabled (already was from Imager config)

4. **Reboot to apply changes**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

Waited 30 seconds, reconnected:
```powershell
ssh prometheus
```

Still works! ✅

#### Essential packages installed:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git curl wget vim htop ufw
```

**What each does:**
- `git`: Download code from GitHub
- `curl` / `wget`: Download files
- `vim`: Text editor (I prefer it over nano)
- `htop`: Beautiful process monitor
- `ufw`: Firewall (security)

**Installation time:** ~2 minutes

#### Firewall configuration:

```bash
# Allow SSH (critical to do this FIRST!)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Allow Kiwix web server (for later)
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

**Checked status:**
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

```
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
```

Perfect! ✅

**Why allow port 22 first?**
If I enabled UFW without allowing SSH, my connection would drop and I'd be locked out. Always allow SSH before enabling firewall!

#### Performance optimizations:

**1. Disabled swap:**

```bash
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
sudo systemctl disable dphys-swapfile
```

Why: SD cards wear out from constant writing. With 8GB RAM, we don't need swap.

Verified:
```bash
free -h
```
```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          7.8Gi       156Mi       7.4Gi       8.0Mi       287Mi       7.5Gi
Swap:            0B          0B          0B
```

Swap: 0B ✅

**2. Disabled unnecessary services:**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl disable hciuart.service
sudo systemctl disable alsa-state.service
```

**RAM saved:** ~50-100 MB  
**Boot time saved:** ~2-3 seconds  
**Why:** Headless server doesn't need Bluetooth or audio

#### Created system monitoring script:

```bash
nano ~/system_status.sh
```

Pasted the monitoring script from guide, saved.

```bash
chmod +x ~/system_status.sh
```

**Tested:**
```bash
~/system_status.sh
```

**Output:**
```

### What I Learned Today

**Technical skills acquired:**
- Flashing OS to SD card with preconfiguration
- Headless Raspberry Pi setup (no monitor needed!)
- SSH key generation and public key authentication
- Linux firewall configuration (UFW)
- System service management (systemd)
- Performance tuning (swap, GPU memory, services)

**Concepts understood:**
- Why SSH keys beat passwords (security + convenience)
- How headless setup saves massive time
- Importance of proper permissions (chmod 700/600)
- Firewall rules and port management
- RAM vs swap trade-offs

**Commands I'm now comfortable with:**
- `ssh` / `ssh-keygen` (remote access)
- `sudo apt update/upgrade` (package management)
- `sudo systemctl` (service control)
- `sudo ufw` (firewall)
- `chmod` (file permissions)
- `free` / `df` / `htop` (system monitoring)

### Problems Encountered

#### 1. SSH Password Annoyance
**Issue:** Having to type password for every connection  
**Impact:** Wasted ~10 seconds per connection  
**Solution:** SSH key authentication  
**Time to fix:** 10 minutes  
**Result:** Now connects in 2 seconds, no password  
**Lesson:** Industry best practice exists for a reason!

#### 2. PowerShell vs Bash Syntax
**Issue:** Git commands from guide used `&&` (Bash syntax)  
**Impact:** PowerShell threw errors  
**Solution:** Use `;` instead of `&&` in PowerShell  
**Example:**
```powershell
# Wrong (Bash):
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# Right (PowerShell):
git add . ; git commit -m "msg" ; git push
```
**Lesson:** Windows != Linux, syntax differs

#### 3. Markdown Confusion
**Issue:** Copied ``` markdown formatters into PowerShell  
**Impact:** PowerShell tried to execute ```, **Ajoute, etc.  
**Solution:** Only copy actual commands, not formatting  
**Lesson:** Triple backticks are for documentation display, not execution!
