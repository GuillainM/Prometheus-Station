### 🔥 A lighthouse when everything burns

## The vision

When civilization's infrastructure collapses—whether by earthquake, war, censorship, or chaos—knowledge becomes the foundation for survival and rebuilding.

**Prometheus Station is a seed vault for human knowledge.**

A solar-powered, self-sufficient knowledge hub that works when the internet doesn't. When cell towers are rubble. When libraries are ash. When asking Google isn't an option.

This is more than emergency medicine. It's the collective wisdom needed to rebuild: how to purify water, grow food, generate power, treat illness, educate children, and maintain the thin veneer we call civilization.

**No internet. No monthly fees. No dependency on infrastructure that can fail.**

Just the accumulated knowledge of humanity, ready to restart civilization from scratch if needed.

---

## What this actually is

Three critical systems in one portable, resilient package:

### 📚 An offline knowledge repository
- Complete Wikipedia (90GB+ in English alone) - Human knowledge, uncensored
- Essential technical skills (engineering, agriculture, construction, energy)
- Medical protocols (emergency medicine, public health, disease prevention)
- Survival fundamentals (water, food, shelter, sanitation, first aid)
- Educational resources (mathematics, sciences, languages, history)
- Access via WiFi hotspot - connect like any network, no internet needed

### 📡 Long-range mesh communication
- LoRa radio network for text messaging
- Range: 1-15km+ depending on terrain
- Works when cell towers don't
- Messages hop through other stations (mesh networking)
- No carrier. No bills. No permission needed.

### ☀️ Energy independence
- Solar-powered with battery backup
- Runs indefinitely without grid power
- Portable or fixed installation
- Operates in disaster zones, remote areas, anywhere with sun

**In practice:** You deploy a backpack-sized station. It creates a WiFi bubble containing the essential knowledge to sustain civilization. People connect with phones, tablets, laptops. No internet required. Knowledge flows. Communities rebuild. Civilization persists.

---

## Why this exists

### The problem

Modern civilization stores its knowledge in the cloud. Wikipedia, textbooks, technical manuals, medical references—all require functioning infrastructure.

**When the grid fails, we lose access to everything we know.**

A doctor in a disaster zone can't look up treatment protocols. Engineers can't reference specifications. Teachers have no materials. Communities lose the technical knowledge needed to maintain water systems, generate power, or grow food efficiently.

### The solution

Decentralize critical knowledge. Make it resilient. Make it accessible. Make it work when everything else fails.

**Prometheus gave humanity fire. This station preserves the knowledge to use it—and everything else we've learned since.**

### Who this serves

- 🏚️ **Post-disaster communities** - Rebuilding infrastructure, restoring services
- 🏥 **Remote medical facilities** - Healthcare without internet connectivity
- 🌍 **Humanitarian operations** - MSF, ICRC, Red Cross field missions
- 📚 **Censored regions** - Access to uncensored human knowledge
- 🏔️ **Off-grid settlements** - Education and technical references
- 🔬 **Remote operations** - Field research, mining, exploration
- 🛡️ **Resilience planners** - Community self-sufficiency preparation
- 🎓 **Educators** - Teaching in areas with unreliable connectivity
- 🏗️ **Development projects** - Building infrastructure in remote areas

**Real-world scenarios this system addresses:**
- 2010 Haiti earthquake - Infrastructure destroyed, technical knowledge needed for rebuilding
- 2013 Typhoon Haiyan - Power grid down, water systems failed, no access to repair manuals
- Syrian conflict zones - Censored internet, isolated communities needing to maintain services
- Remote settlements - Zero connectivity, need technical references for infrastructure
- Refugee camps - Educational resources non-existent, children growing up without schooling
- Grid failures - Extended power outages eliminating access to online resources

**Rebuilding scenarios:**
- Post-disaster reconstruction - Engineers need specs, builders need plans
- Water system restoration - Communities need purification and distribution knowledge
- Educational continuity - Teachers and students need curriculum materials
- Medical capability - Healthcare workers need protocols and references
- Agricultural recovery - Farmers need information on crops, soil, irrigation

**Long-term resilience:**
- Remote settlements - Off-grid communities maintaining civilization
- Refugee camps - Displaced populations educating next generation
- Indigenous preservation - Communities documenting and sharing traditional knowledge

## 🔥 The fire we carry 🔥

In a world where knowledge is centralized, connectivity is fragile, and infrastructure can vanish overnight...

**We choose resilience.**

We build systems that work when nothing else does.
We preserve knowledge that cannot be extinguished.
We light beacons in the darkness.

**Prometheus Station is a lighthouse when everything burns.**
