# Prometheus Station
### 🔥 Bringing Fire to Humanity, One Station at a Time

---

## The Idea

Imagine you're in a disaster zone. Infrastructure has collapsed. A medical emergency happens. Someone needs critical information to save a life.

**What if you could still access emergency medical protocols? What if you could communicate over kilometers without any infrastructure?**

That's Prometheus Station: a solar-powered knowledge hub combining **offline medical encyclopedias** with **long-range radio communication**. No internet required. No monthly fees. No infrastructure dependency.

This project documents building such a station from scratch—written by someone who knew nothing about Raspberry Pi, LoRa networks, or solar power systems before starting. **If I can build this, you can too.**

---

## What This Actually Is

**Prometheus Station** is three things combined:

1. **🏥 An offline medical & knowledge library** - Emergency medical protocols, Wikipedia, and survival guides accessible via WiFi
2. **📡 A long-range messenger** - LoRa mesh network for text communication over several kilometers 
3. **☀️ A self-sufficient system** - Solar-powered, runs indefinitely without external power

**Practical translation:**
- You deploy a backpack-sized device to a disaster zone or remote location
- It creates a local WiFi hotspot serving **medical emergency protocols** and knowledge
- People connect with their phones/laptops like any wifi network—no internet needed
- It enables text messaging between devices over long distances (1-15km+)
- Everything runs on solar power—no external electricity required

**Real-world uses:**
- 🚑 **Emergency/disaster response** - Medical protocols when infrastructure fails
- 🏥 **Remote medical clinics** - Access to medical knowledge offline
- 🌍 **Humanitarian missions** - Field deployment by MSF, ICRC, Red Cross
- 🏔️ **Off-grid communities** - Education and communication
- 🔬 **Field research expeditions** - Knowledge base in remote areas
- 🌐 **Areas with censored internet** - Uncensored information access
- 🛡️ **Just-in-case resilience** - Community preparedness

## Why This Repository Exists

Most tech projects are documented by experts, for experts. They skip the "obvious" parts—obvious to them, confusing to beginners.

**This is different.**

I'm documenting this build as a complete beginner. Every problem I hit, every confusion, every wrong turn—it's all in here. The goal: someone else should be able to replicate this without experiencing the same trial and error.

Think of it as "beginner to beginner" documentation. If you've never touched a Raspberry Pi, never heard of LoRa, and think "ZIM files" sound like a snack—you're in the right place.
