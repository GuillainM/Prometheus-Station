# Prometheus Station
### 🔥 A Lighthouse When Everything Burns

</div>

---

## The Vision

When civilization's infrastructure collapses—whether by earthquake, war, censorship, or chaos—knowledge becomes the most precious resource.

**Prometheus Station is a beacon in the darkness.**

A solar-powered, self-sufficient knowledge repository that works when the internet doesn't. When cell towers are rubble. When libraries are ash. When asking Google isn't an option.

This is the Library of Alexandria for the apocalypse. A lifeboat filled with humanity's accumulated wisdom, ready to deploy anywhere, serving anyone within reach.

**No internet. No monthly fees. No dependency on infrastructure that can fail.**

Just knowledge, communication, and light in the darkness.

---

## What This Actually Is

Three critical systems in one portable, resilient package:

### 📚 An Offline Knowledge Repository
- Complete Wikipedia (90GB+ in English alone)
- Emergency medical protocols (WHO, MSF, ICRC field guides)
- Survival knowledge (water purification, food safety, emergency procedures)
- Educational content in multiple languages
- Access via WiFi hotspot - connect like any network, no internet needed

### 📡 Long-Range Mesh Communication
- LoRa radio network for text messaging
- Range: 1-15km+ depending on terrain
- Works when cell towers don't
- Messages hop through other stations (mesh networking)
- No carrier. No bills. No permission needed.

### ☀️ Energy Independence
- Solar-powered with battery backup
- Runs indefinitely without grid power
- Portable or fixed installation
- Operates in disaster zones, remote areas, anywhere with sun

**In practice:** You deploy a backpack-sized station. It creates a WiFi bubble containing all human knowledge. People connect with phones, tablets, laptops. No internet required. Knowledge flows. Lives are saved.

---

## Why This Exists

### The Problem

Knowledge is centralized. Wikipedia requires internet. Medical references are online. When infrastructure fails, we go blind.

**We've built a civilization dependent on fragile systems.**

### The Solution

Decentralize critical knowledge. Make it resilient. Make it accessible. Make it work when everything else fails.

**Prometheus gave humanity fire. We're giving humanity knowledge that can't be extinguished.**

### Who This Serves

- 🚑 **Disaster zones** - Earthquake, hurricane, flood response teams
- 🏥 **Remote clinics** - Medical workers in underserved areas
- 🌍 **Humanitarian missions** - MSF, ICRC, Red Cross field operations
- 📚 **Censored regions** - Access to uncensored information
- 🏔️ **Off-grid communities** - Education without infrastructure
- 🔬 **Field research** - Knowledge base in remote locations
- 🛡️ **Resilience planners** - Community preparedness
- 🎓 **Educators** - Teaching in low-connectivity areas

**Real-world examples this system was designed for:**
- 2010 Haiti earthquake - infrastructure destroyed, medical knowledge inaccessible
- 2013 Typhoon Haiyan - hospitals offline, protocols needed
- Syrian conflict zones - censored internet, limited medical access
- Remote Amazon clinics - zero connectivity, life-or-death decisions daily
- Refugee camps - educational resources non-existent

## 🔥 The Fire We Carry 🔥

In a world where knowledge is centralized, connectivity is fragile, and infrastructure can vanish overnight...

**We choose resilience.**

We build systems that work when nothing else does.
We preserve knowledge that cannot be extinguished.
We light beacons in the darkness.

**Prometheus Station is a lighthouse when everything burns.**
