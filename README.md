# Prometheus Station
### 🔥 Bringing Fire to Humanity, One Station at a Time

---

## The Idea

Imagine you're in a place with no internet. Maybe you're deep in the mountains, on a remote island, or in an area where infrastructure has failed. A medical emergency happens. A technical problem needs solving. A student wants to learn.

**What if you could still access all of Wikipedia? What if you could communicate over kilometers without cell towers or wifi?**

That's Prometheus Station: a solar-powered knowledge hub combining offline Wikipedia with long-range radio communication. No internet required. No monthly fees. No infrastructure dependency.

This project documents building such a station from scratch—written by someone who knew nothing about Raspberry Pi, LoRa networks, or solar power systems before starting. **If I can build this, you can too.**

## What This Actually Is

**Prometheus Station** is three things combined:

1. **📚 An offline library** - Complete Wikipedia (English + French) and medical encyclopedias accessible via WiFi
2. **📡 A long-range messenger** - LoRa mesh network for text communication over several kilometers 
3. **☀️ A self-sufficient system** - Solar-powered, runs indefinitely without external power

**Practical translation:**
- You carry a backpack-sized device to a remote location
- It creates a local WiFi hotspot serving Wikipedia and medical knowledge
- People connect with their phones/laptops like any wifi network—no internet needed
- It also enables text messaging between devices over long distances (1-15km+)
- Everything runs on solar power

**Real-world uses:**
- Emergency/disaster response (power outage, natural disaster)
- Remote medical clinics (access to medical knowledge offline)
- Off-grid communities (education, communication)
- Field research expeditions
- Areas with censored/controlled internet
- Just-in-case resilience for your community

## Why This Repository Exists

Most tech projects are documented by experts, for experts. They skip the "obvious" parts—obvious to them, confusing to beginners.

**This is different.**

I'm documenting this build as a complete beginner. Every problem I hit, every confusion, every wrong turn—it's all in here. The goal: someone else should be able to replicate this without experiencing the same trial and error.

Think of it as "beginner to beginner" documentation. If you've never touched a Raspberry Pi, never heard of LoRa, and think "ZIM files" sound like a snack—you're in the right place.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**⚠️ Work in Progress ⚠️**

This project is being built in real-time. Documentation will grow as I figure things out.

Current roadmap:
1. ✅ Hardware acquired
2. ⏳ Raspberry Pi OS setup
3. ⏳ Kiwix installation + Wikipedia dumps
4. ⏳ Meshtastic configuration
5. ⏳ Integration & testing
6. ⏳ Solar power optimization

Check [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md) for real-time progress updates.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

> Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity.
> 
> We're stealing knowledge from the cloud and giving it to anyone with a radio.

This project is:
- **Beginner-friendly** - documented by a beginner, for beginners
- **Resilient** - works when nothing else does
- **Open** - free as in freedom, free as in beer
- **Practical** - real hardware, real tests, real problems solved
